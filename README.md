# Independent Study - Learning Tkinter
Leo Widajewski

## Setup / Prerequisites
Pulling the specific ollama model to your machine
"ollama pull aryanvala/hushiyar-lite"

Running "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the ollama library

## How to Run Program
You can't use code runner for this project, you have to run the 'main.py' file in a terminal.

## Additional Notes
This is an independent study and the code is by no means optimized/organized well. This was a learning experience for me (Leo).
